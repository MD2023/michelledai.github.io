Hello everyone! I am Michelle Dai, a 2nd year Ph.D student at Johns Hopkins University in the [Applied Math and Statistics Department](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/). I've loved numbers since I was young, but I was in high school when I began to consider the power data has to contribute to the betterment of society. At the North Carolina School of Science and Math [(NCSSM)](https://www.ncssm.edu), I am grateful to have received various research opportunities that exposed me to statistical applications in a diverse range of fields, such as monitoring cardiac arrhythmia, [measuring air pollution](https://www.scirp.org/Journal/paperinformation?paperid=86311), and [viral epidemiology.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8362278) 

I attended Princeton University for my undergraduate studies, during which I focused my statistical interests on machine learning. To attain my B.S.E. in Operations Research and Financial Engineering and a minor in Finance, I completed an [undergraduate thesis](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp0112579w54m) under the guidance of [Dr. Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu) on using feedforward neural networks to predict American options prices. I earned a minor in Statistics and Machine Learning with a machine learning project about using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in autonomous driving. After graduation, I worked at the [World Bank Treasury](https://treasury.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/treasury) in Washington, DC, having been inspired by its goals to eradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity worldwide.

Now at Johns Hopkins University, I seek to take advantage of its robust medical resources and the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant advisors and peers to continue pursuing what has always motivated me; harnessing technological tools for the betterment of mankind.
